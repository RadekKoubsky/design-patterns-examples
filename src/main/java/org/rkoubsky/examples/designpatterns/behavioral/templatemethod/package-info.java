/**
 * The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to
 * subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without
 * changing the algorithm's structure.
 * <p>
 * The Hollywood Principle:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Don't call us, we will call you.
 * </p>
 * <p>Comparison with other patterns:</p>
 * <p>The Strategy Pattern and Template Pattern both encapsulate algorithms, one
 * by composition and one by inheritance.</p>
 * <p>The Factory Method is a specialization of Template Method</p>
