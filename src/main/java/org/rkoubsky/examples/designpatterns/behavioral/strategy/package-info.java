/**
 * The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms,
 * encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
 * Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from
 * clients that use it.
 * <p>
 * <p>Design principles:</p>
 * <p>Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate
 * them from what stays the same.</p>
 * <p>Program to an interface, not an implementation.</p>
 * <p>Favor composition over inheritance.</p>
