/**
 * The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures
 * to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite Pattern lets clients treat
 * individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
 * <p>
 * Using a composite structure, we can apply the same operations
 * over both composites and individual objects. In other words, in most cases we can ignore
 * the differences between composition of objects and individual objects.
