/**
 * The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating
 * families of related or dependent objects without specifying their
 * concrete classes.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * It uses Factory Method pattern for creating products from
 * the Abstract Factory, thus concrete factories are responsible
 * for creating concrete products by implementing Factory Method
 * from the abstract factory.
